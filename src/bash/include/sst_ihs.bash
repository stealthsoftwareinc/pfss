# This function may be called by sst_install_utility, so we need to be
# careful to only use utilities that are always available and run them
# with "command", and we need to explicitly call sst_err_trap on error
# to handle errexit suspension correctly. errexit suspension will occur
# when the user uses idioms such as "foo || s=$?" or "if foo; then" and
# foo triggers our automatic utility installation system. In this case,
# we want to maintain the behavior expected by the user but still barf
# if the installation of foo fails.
