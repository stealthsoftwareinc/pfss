PFSS is a library for function secret sharing (FSS) developed by Stealth
Software Technologies,{nbsp}Inc.{nbsp}(Stealth).
Our library provides APIs for performing an efficient two-way sharing of
point functions based on the work from Gilboa-Ishai (EUROCRYPT 2014) and
Boyle-Gilboa-Ishai (EUROCRYPT 2015) with optimizations from the
Boyle-Gilboa-Ishai (CCS 2016) result.
We also provide batched APIs to reduce overhead, which is useful for
applications that use FSS for large-scale computations, such as our
recent work of applying FSS to various flavors of Private Set
Intersection.
For the latter work, we provide a reference to Dittmer et al. on
