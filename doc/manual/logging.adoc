= Logging

PFSS includes a logging layer that can be enabled at build time by
specifying the `--with-logging` option to `./configure`.
When logging is enabled and a log file has been set by calling the
`<<cl_pfss_set_log_file>>` function, every call to the PFSS C API will
write a line to the log file with information about the call.
Each line has the following format, which is based on the format used by
the `{strace}` utility:

[source,subs="normal"]
----
__time__ __func__(__args__) = __ret__ <__dura__>
----

`__time__`:: The {Unix_time} at which the call was made, in nanoseconds.

`__func__`:: The name of the function that was called.

`__args__`:: The arguments that were passed to the function.

`__ret__`:: The value the function returned.

`__dura__`:: The amount of time the call took, in nanoseconds.
