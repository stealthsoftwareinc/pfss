= Node.js bindings

== General

The Node.js bindings are provided in the
link:src/node[`src/node`]
directory, which is actually an example project.
The intent is that you can take
link:src/node/pfss-node.cpp[`pfss-node.cpp`]
verbatim and adapt
link:src/node/binding.gyp[`binding.gyp`]
and
link:src/node/package.json[`package.json`]
into your own project.

== Running the example project with Docker

. Build a distribution archive (`pfss-*.tar.gz`) by running `make dist`
(after `./configure`).

. Copy the distribution archive into the `src/node` directory.
Make sure you have exactly one such file in that directory.
If you don't have exactly one, the image won't build.

. Run `docker build -t pfss-node src/node` to build the image.

. Run `docker run -i -t --rm pfss-node` to start a container.

. In the container, run `npm install` followed by `node-gyp rebuild`.

. In the container, run `node example.js`.
