= The pages site

This directory holds the pages site, which is a static website that can
be hosted anywhere, but in particular on hosts like GitHub Pages and
GitLab Pages.
You might find redundant copies of this directory depending on how
you're browsing the project.
Such copies only exist to satisfy location requirements of certain
hosts.
The single source of truth is the `doc/pages` directory in the source
repository.
